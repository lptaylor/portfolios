## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  I set out with the goal of learning the basics of the Ruby language and to
be able to write a program. I feel I was very successful in accomplishing this.
If you had told me I would be able to do half of what I can now when I was doing
the prework I would have not believed it.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  Learning how classes work and the importance of OOP. I now feel I understand some
of the reasons why OOP is great. The ability to program something that has state and
behavior and be able to add or remove functionality from it as you continue is amazing.
It also helps me look at a large problem and break it into smaller components as this
was a huge struggle for me initially.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  I loved all of them for different reasons Sorting Cards was a great way to learn
about basic algorithms. Battleship taught me to approach a problem from an OOP mindset.
Black Thursday showed me that Modules can be a very important part of a project and that
you can program a computer to do some cool stuff from an analytics side. Finally Enigma
was just a fun program to build and was a great way to end the module.

  If I was to choose my least favorite project it might be Sorting Cards as the struggle
for me to understand what we were doing at the time was very frustrating.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  From the independent projects I learned that I need to be okay with not understanding everything and that I can ask questions.
One of my larger setbacks was initially that I felt that if I asked someone a question as
in Sorting Cards that I would be cheating or something. I also learned to trust myself
when I make a design decision that is different from another person as there are many
different and often equally valid ways to approach a problem.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  I learned from the paired projects that working with a group and giving space to
others ideas about a problem can help not only the project move forward but also help
me look at a problem in an entirely new way. I also learned that while a person in a group
might not be the loudest or fastest coder they can often contribute in their own ways by
helping the team move forward in a more clean way.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I did my best to help others when they were struggling with a problem that I felt I
could help with. I also have tried to be someone who people can talk to about what is
going on in their lives and how stuff is going at Turing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to continue building on what I have done already with the friendships I
have made here already and would love to be available to help incoming Mod 1 students
with whatever they need.
